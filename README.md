# Extract, Load, Transform Project
The Extract, Load, Transform (ETL) Pipeline focused on designing and implementing a robust data pipeline that integrates multiple data sources and storage systems. The primary goal was to facilitate efficient data extraction, transformation, and loading using a combination of MongoDB, a locally hosted MySQL database, and local filesystem data. 

The project involved:

Extraction: Retrieving structured and unstructured data from a csv stored locally.
Loading: Importing the extracted data into a MySQL database for structured storage and querying.
Transformation: Cleaning, processing, and structuring the data to ensure consistency and usability within MongoDB.

By building this ETL pipeline, the project demonstrated effective data integration, automation of data workflows, and optimization of data handling processes. The final pipeline provided a scalable and efficient solution for managing diverse data sources, enhancing accessibility and analytical capabilities.
